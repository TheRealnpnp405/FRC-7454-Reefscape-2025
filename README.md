# FRC 7454 Huskies on Hogs – Reefscape 2025

This repo contains the full Java code I developed for the 2025 FIRST Robotics Competition season whilst on team 7454 Huskies on Hogs.

## Why I’m sharing this code

My experience with FRC helped me discover that I want to be a computer engineer. Along the way, I built friendships with other FIRST programmers, sharing questions, support, and ideas. I strive to show gracious professionalism and coopertition in all parts of my life.

I’m sharing this code to support the FIRST community and help other teams learn, grow, and innovate. FIRST is about discovery, innovation, impact, inclusion, teamwork, and fun—and sharing what we learn is a big part of that.

## About me and the team

Over my four years on the team, I was able to teach STEAM skills to over 10,000 students. FIRST helped me discover my passion for computer engineering and gave me the chance to make meaningful connections with mentors and peers. It taught me the value of teamwork, gracious professionalism, and coopertition. I mentored a junior high VEX team and worked to spread awareness of FIRST through tours, presentations, and community events. Being part of this team shaped who I am, and I hope this code helps others find their own path and inspiration.

Thank you FIRST.
